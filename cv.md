### Code Example:
**There are pillars near the road. The distance between the pillars is the same and the width of the pillars is the same. Your function accepts three arguments:**

*number of pillars (≥ 1);*
*distance between pillars (10 - 30 meters);*
*width of the pillar (10 - 50 centimeters).*
*Calculate the distance between the first and the last pillar in centimeters (without the width of the first and last pillar).*

```
function pillars(num_pill, dist, width) {
  if (num_pill <= 1) return 0;
  
  let finalDistance = 0;
  let distance = dist * 100
  
  finalDistance = (num_pill * width) + ((num_pill * distance) - distance) - (width * 2)
  
  return finalDistance
}
```
